# Machine Learning Practices

A repository documenting my journey and experiments in Machine Learning.

## Overview

This repository contains my practice projects and implementations as I learn Machine Learning concepts. I'm currently following the book [LLMs in Production](https://github.com/IMJONEZZ/LLMs-in-Production/) as a guide and have also used the excellent [3Blue1Brown neural networks video series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks#neural-networks) to solidify my understanding of the fundamental concepts.

## Featured Projects

### MNIST Digit Recognition

Try out the "Hello World" of Neural Networks! This implementation uses the MNIST dataset containing 60,000 handwritten digit images to build a classifier that can recognize handwritten numbers.

#### Running the Project

1. Create a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python MNIST.py
   ```

#### Customization

Feel free to experiment with the code! You can modify:

- Neural network architecture (layers, neurons)
- Number of training epochs
- Batch size
- Learning rate

## Future Projects

Stay tuned for more implementations as I progress through my Machine Learning journey!
